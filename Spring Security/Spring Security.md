Spring Sercurity provides the authentication and access-control.

I'll use the package with dependencies: 
- Spring Web 
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database
- JDBC API


We will get the authentification window, /login and /logout endpoints from the box, without single line of code. Spring Security adds mandatory authentication for all API endpoints. It creates one default user with name "user", and generates the security password, that can be seen in console during the startup.
