Spring Data JPA can be used for all database types in principle, but it performs good and convenient only with relational databases (normal SQL databases).

Spring Data MongoDB is constructed specially for MongoDB NoSQL database. It allows the usage of full functionality of MongoDB, and not "adhoc adapting for NoSQL" of Spring Data JPA.
