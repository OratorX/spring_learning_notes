If we want to use some NoSQL Database, like MongoDB, Spring Data JPA can be used, but it will be sometimes tricky, it will introduce complex dependencies and might just not work. More aboud difference between [[Spring Data MongoDB vs Spring Data JPA]]

There is more convenient to use the specialised frameworks for NoSQL databases. 

For this part i'll use a project with following dependencies: 
- Spring Web
- Spring Data MongoDB


[[Creating a MongoDB instance]]
[[Connecting to MongoDB]]
[[Getting Data from MongoDB]]
