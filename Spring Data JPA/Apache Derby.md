Small embedded database, that can be used for development, before the remote database server is available. It is configured by spring automatically.

Wonderful tool to start the project or for learning purpose, if we don't need any production database. It can be used as in-memory database (without any persisting, default mode) and in persisting mode (directory should be configured and some properties should be set).
