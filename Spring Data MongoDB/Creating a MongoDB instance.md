## Creating a MongoDB instance

At first, i'll use a free MongoDB Atlas instance: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/

I'll create the database sandbox with username admin and password admin_password.

Make sure, that you have added your IP adress to IP whitelist on atlas, or your connection will be refused. You can also allow connection from everywhere.


## Database IDE
I'll use DataGrip to view and manipulate the database. There are also good free alternatives, my personal open-souce favourite is DBeaver.
